This plugin is only available if 'compatible' is not set.
The plugin requires Vim to be compiled with +signs and +clientserver and Vim 
version >= 7. To check it, run >
	:echo has("signs") && has("clientserver") && v:version > 700
Result should be equal to 1
If you use Linux, make sure you have "lsof" installed. See >
	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lsof

Also, it requires ruby-debug-ide gem. To install it, run >
	gem install ruby-debug-ide

Please make sure, that vim/gvim, rdebug-ide and ruby directories are set in your
$PATH variable

{Vi does not have any of this}

==============================================================================
INTRODUCTION			*ruby-debugger-introduction* *ruby-debugger*

This plugin implements interactive Ruby debugger in Vim.

1. It can debug any Ruby application (Rails, by default), using ruby-debug-ide
gem

2. The debugger looks like in the Netbeans - you can go through the code, watch
variables, breakpoints in separate window, set and remove breakpoints.

3. It supports command-line rdebug commands. E.g., you can you can execute >
	:RdbCommand p User.all
in command line of VIM and it will display result like usual echo VIM command.

==============================================================================
INSTALLATION					*ruby-debugger-installation*

Extract files from archive to vimfiles (Windows) or ~/.vim (everything else).
You should have the following files: >
	plugin/ruby_debugger.vim
	bin/ruby_debugger.rb
	doc/ruby_debugger.txt
The first one is a debugger plugin, second is a small ruby script, that makes
interaction between the VIM and the ruby-debug-ide gem, and third is help file.

Then, run: >
	:helptags ~/.vim/doc
for generating local tags file.

Now you can use the >
	:help ruby-debugger
and watch help file you just added.

==============================================================================
QUICKSTART					*ruby-debugger-quickstart*

1. Run Vim. If you use gvim, it will automatically start the server, but if
   you use vim, you need to set servername explicitly, e.g., >
	vim --servername VIM

2. Go to the directory with some your Rails application. >
	:cd ~/projects/rails

3. Run Server with Debugger: >
	:Rdebugger

It will kill any listeners of ports 39767 and 39768 and run rdebug-ide and
~/.vim/bin/ruby_debugger.rb on these ports accordingly.

3. Set breakpoint somewhere by <Leader>b (usually, '\b'). You should see
   "xx" symbol at the current line.

4. Open page with the breakpoint in the browser. Vim should automatically set
   its current line to breakpoint.

5. After this, you can use commands:
   * <Leader>b - set breakpoint at current line
   * <Leader>v - open/close window with variables. You can expand/collapse
                 variables by 'o' in normal mode or left-mouse double-click
   * <Leader>m - open/close window with breakpoints. You can open file with
                 breakpoint by pressing 'o' or left-mouse double-click on it,
                 or delete the breakpoint by pressing 'd' on it.
   * <Leader>n - step over
   * <Leader>s - step into
   * <Leader>c - continue

==============================================================================
DETAILS					*ruby-debugger-details*

1. Of course, you can set your own mappings instead of mine. For this, just
   add this to your .vimrc and change keys for mapping:
>
	map <Leader>b  :call g:RubyDebugger.toggle_breakpoint()<CR>
	map <Leader>v  :call g:RubyDebugger.open_variables()<CR>
	map <Leader>m  :call g:RubyDebugger.open_breakpoints()<CR>
	map <Leader>s  :call g:RubyDebugger.step()<CR>
	map <Leader>n  :call g:RubyDebugger.next()<CR>
	map <Leader>c  :call g:RubyDebugger.continue()<CR>
	map <Leader>e  :call g:RubyDebugger.exit()<CR>
>
2. Standard output of running script is redirected to
~/.vim/tmp/ruby_debugger_output file (only for POSIX systems - Linux, MacOS) 

3. To run some other Ruby application (not Rails), you should specify its
   path as argument of Rdebugger command. E.g. >
	:Rdebugger bla.rb

4. To run some rdebug command, use :RdbCommand. E.g.: >
	:RdbCommand p User.find_by_name(\"john\").created_at

5. For communicating with the rdebug the plugin uses temp file:
   ~/.vim/tmp/ruby_debugger. Rdebug writes some response to this file, "kicks"
   the plugin remotely calling RubyDebugger.receive_command() by Vim's
   client-server functionality and the plugin make actions. For this reason,
   you need Vim compiled with +clientserver.

6. The plugin logs all its actions to ~/.vim/tmp/ruby_debugger_log.

7. You also can run Unit tests for the plugin. For this, copy to 
   ~/.vim/plugin/ ruby_debugger_test.vim instead of ruby_debugger.vim. It has
   the same functionality, but with unit tests at end of the file. To run
   unit tests, run >
	call g:TU.run()
